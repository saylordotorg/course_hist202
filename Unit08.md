**Unit 8: Dictatorships and the Second World War** <span id="8"></span> 
*World War I had mobilized centralized state power on an unprecedented
scale.  Such an incredible exertion of power had seemed necessary in
order to muster all available state resources in an atmosphere of “total
war.”  But this trend of centralized power continued in postwar Europe,
and when combined with fervent nationalism, led to the rise of several
totalitarian or authoritarian regimes.  Stalin’s Russia, Franco’s Spain,
Mussolini’s Fascist Italy, and Hitler’s Nazi Germany all used oppressive
rule to restore order and prosperity to nations wracked by war.  It was
the alliance of these three regimes that eventually resulted in the
outbreak of World War II in 1939.  Hitler’s invasion of Poland and
France ignited a war that would last five years, span five continents,
and claim millions of lives. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will see that the aggressive, totalitarian
nationalism of the 1920s and early 1930s was fueled by the economic
downturn of the Great Depression, social unrest, and an uncertain
political landscape.  In particular, we will study how Adolf Hitler
garnered the support of a disenchanted Germany and built his
“racially-pure” Nazi state.  We will also examine the military battles
of the war as well as what many believe to be the greatest tragedy of
the twentieth century— the Holocaust.*

    Shooting.  This is a first-person account of the mass death of Jews
    at Dubno, Ukraine in 1942.  About 5,000 Jews in this region were
    “marked for liquidation” by the Nazis, and the speaker, a Ukrainian
    engineer, estimates that approximately 1,500 were shot daily and
    then buried in mass graves.  The account, though disturbing, shows
    the well-organized extermination procedures that the SS, an elite
    Nazi paramilitary unit, had started to use by the third year of
    World War II.
