**Unit 3: War, Ideologies, and Upheavals, 1800-1856** <span
id="3"></span> 
*The nineteenth century saw drastic political changes that had been
initiated by the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent reorganization of
the political map of Europe via the Congress of Vienna in 1815. 
Interestingly, the Vienna Settlement was intended to restore stability
to the European state system; however, the first half of the nineteenth
century was characterized by widespread social and political unrest. The
era later became known as the “Age of Revolutions.”  Still, different
nation-states reacted in different ways to the revolutionary fervor that
pervaded Europe.  Britain, Austria, and ultra-royalist France responded
with conservative nationalism.  In Greece and Serbia, radical
independence movements emerged.  In 1848, a revolution in France quickly
spread throughout most of Europe, resulting in a bloody contest between
nobles and the discontented middle and working classes. This unit ends
with an analysis of the Crimean War and why it is considered to be the
first “modern” war in history.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how Europe’s rejection of the
eighteenth-century world and its Enlightenment ideals resulted in the
rise of liberal nationalism, social unrest, and the emergence of
Romanticism.*

    European politics as it dramatically weakened French hegemony in
    Europe.  As a result, the reputation of Napoleon as an undefeated
    military genius was severely shaken.
