**Unit 1: A Revolution in Industry** <span id="1"></span> 
*Although industrialization in Britain began in the eighteenth century,
it was not until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 that its impact
became apparent in the continent; but by 1850, industrialization
permeated all of Europe.  The development of steam power fueled the
creation of railroads, new cities, and a new factory system.  These
advancements revolutionized Europe, reconfiguring the structure of
society and the nature of the economy.  Europe advanced rapidly during
this period, but it did so at a cost:  the factory system cheapened the
labor value of workers, factory conditions were often horrible, and a
rift between the working class and factory owners began to develop.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how industrialization changed the face of
Europe in the nineteenth century, noting that different countries
experienced the industrial age through varying terms and to different
extents.*
