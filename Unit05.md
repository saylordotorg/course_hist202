**Unit 5: Europe and the World** <span id="5"></span> 
*During the latter half of the nineteenth century, European powers (as
well as Japan) held unprecedented colonial control over regions in
Africa, China, and India.  Known as “New Imperialism,” this era was
unlike other periods of international competition in that
empire-building in the latter part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century
monopolized all aspects of European political, economic, and social
life.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see that colonization in the late 1800s was
driven by several factors.  First, advancements in industry—electricity,
mass-produced steel, petro-chemicals—helped fuel imperial pursuits. 
Second, population pressure at home caused many Europeans to migrate to
new imperial outposts.  Lastly, nationalism and increased competition
among European states stimulated colonial expansion.  In Africa, for
example, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy “scrambled” for colonial
control.*
