**Unit 9: Cold War Conflicts and Social Transformations, 1945-1985**
<span id="9"></span> 
*By 1945, a second world war and European global domination were over. 
This created a power vacuum, and the United States and the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) moved from reluctant wartime allies to
deadly adversaries.  In this East versus West contest, Communist USSR
and Soviet-controlled eastern Europe were pitted against the democratic
United States and western Europe.  Although these two factions never
clashed on the battlefield, the conflict was evident in military
coalitions, a nuclear arms race, espionage, proxy wars, propaganda, and
technological competition, such as the Space Race.  For these reasons,
the forty year period following World War II is known as the “Cold
War.”*  
  
 *The Cold War continued to dominate global politics for decades and was
a direct cause of the Korean War (1950-1953), the Vietnam War
(1959-1975), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), and the Soviet War in
Afghanistan (1979-1989).  But in the late 1980s, the United States
increased diplomatic, economic, and military pressures on the USSR,
resulting in Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s introduction of the
liberal reforms of perestroika (“reconstruction”) and glasnost
(“openness”).  However, these Communist reforms weakened the bonds that
held the Soviet Union together.  In 1989, revolutions staged in Hungary,
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania successfully
overthrew Communism, leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the clash between democracy and Communism
between 1945 and 1985, and we will examine the lasting social, economic,
and political consequences of the Cold War conflict.*

    that women throughout history have been defined as the “other” sex. 
    She insists on the reality of sexual difference, but she also argues
    that it is immoral to use that difference to exploit women. Her
    well-known phrase, “one is not born but becomes a woman,” introduces
    what is now known as the sex-gender distinction.
