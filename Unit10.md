**Unit 10: The European Integration** <span id="10"></span> 
*In 1946, Winston Churchill called for a “United States of Europe” in a
speech given at University of Zurich, but it was not until 1950 that the
formation of an integrated Europe began to develop when France, Italy,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg joined together to try
to find ways to prevent another world war.  In these early days of
European integration, the focus was on common trade policies for coal,
steel, and agriculture.  Thus, the first Europe-wide organization was
dubbed the European Coal and Steel Community.  As this collective grew
and expanded, it transformed first into the European Economic Community
(1957) and then into the European Union (1993).*  
  
 *This unit emphasizes various aspects of the European integration
process and covers the time period between the end of World War I in
1919 and the creation of the European Union.  In this unit, students
will analyze European integration as a historical process and will be
asked to think critically about various aspects of more recent European
politics (Law, Political Science, Economics and Economic History, etc). 
We will conclude by reflecting on the future of European Union.*
