**Unit 2: An Emerging Urban Society** <span id="2"></span> 
*The industrial age resulted in a profound population shift from rural
areas to cities.  Millions of people relocated to burgeoning industrial
towns to take up work in large factories that manufactured textiles
imported from America, Africa, or India.  The transition from an
agricultural lifestyle to an urban one resulted in widespread social
change throughout Europe.  Women and children began working in
factories, affecting marriage patterns and family structure.  The rise
of the new factory system created a stark divide between the middle and
working classes.  Explosive population growth in cities led to
unsanitary conditions and prevalent disease.  As a result of this
population shift, the 19<sup>th</sup> century witnessed a rapid
expansion of scientific knowledge and an increasing emphasis on
realism—the depiction of subjects as they appear in everyday life,
without embellishment or interpretation—in literature.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the urbanization of the industrial age as
a crucible for social change and identify various literary and
scientific advancements.*
