**Unit 6: The Great War** <span id="6"></span> 
*In the late nineteenth century, a new alliance system developed in
Europe.  In the 1890s, the Triple Alliance was formed between Austria,
Germany, and Italy.  Meanwhile, Britain became an ally of Japan in 1902,
formed the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904, and drew up a similar
agreement with Russia in 1907.  In the early 1900s, these two alliances
had a major focus: the Balkans.  Russia and Austria both vied for the
region; a crisis broke out when an Austrian heir was assassinated at
Sarajevo in June of 1914.  The Balkan calamity became the immediate
cause of the Great War, a conflict that involved 30 countries and left
over 30 million people dead.  Trench warfare in Europe and the use of
modern weapons, such as the machine gun and poison gas, made World War I
the deadliest in history.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the causes and effects of the Great War. 
We will see that within five years (1914-1919), the European landscape
changed completely; the German, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Russian
empires were either crippled or totally destroyed by war’s end.*
