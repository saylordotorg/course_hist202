**Unit 7: Age of Anxiety** <span id="7"></span> 
*The 1919 Treaty of Versailles was intended to repair a war-weary
Europe, but it actually became the leading cause of conflict in the
postwar era.  Germany was humiliated by the reparations demanded by the
Entente powers.  The newly established eastern European states did not
accept the boundaries created for them.  The European world was so
shaken by the war that many efforts at stabilization or organization
were met with skepticism or violence.  In order to make sense of the new
postwar landscape, writers, scientists, religious leaders, and
philosophers developed new theories and ideas that were radically
different from those that had dominated Europe before the war.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the literature, social science, and
empirical philosophy that emerged out of the skeptical worldview
fomented by the Great War.  We will also consider how the problematic
Treaty of Versailles and the onset of the Great Depression in 1929
created an era of instability and confusion.*
