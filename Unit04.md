**Unit 4: Age of Nationalism, 1850-1914** <span id="4"></span> 
*Despite the widespread violence and chaos unleashed by the Revolutions
of 1848, European nations implemented few reforms.  As a result, the
revolutions were largely deemed failures.  However, the revolutionary
moment did succeed in motivating many European leaders (most famously
Bismarck of Prussia and Cavour of Italy) to create unified and
bureaucratic nation-states.  The Concert of Europe—the balance of power
among European countries that had been created in 1815—dissolved into
independent states that were buttressed by fierce nationalistic
sentiment and emerged in competition with one another.  By the 1870s,
the European great power system had been transformed from a network of
royalist states to a set of independent countries energized by a common
commitment to liberal reform and a national identity.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how nationalism fueled the development of
bureaucratic nation-states that emphasized homogeneity, unity, and
distinctiveness.*
